      I grew up in Newton, Massachussets. I am currently a student at Babson
      College. I enjoy to learn new things about technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose
      <a href="https://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a>
      because I wanted to go to a small business school and it was also
      convenient that it was close to home. After graduation I plan to work in
      the either the Analytics or IT field.
    </p>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

      join tournaments with a team and compete competitively. My favorite game
      to play right now is

      like to watch sports. My favorite sport would have to be Soccer, I love to
      watch and play it.
